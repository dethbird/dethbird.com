Title: Storystation Demo Video v1

#### At a desk

We see the back of the host and hear VIOLENT EATING SOUNDS.

HOST
(turns to the camera)
Oh, hi!

A bunch of candy falls out of his mouth and his clothes are covered in chocolate stains.

HOST
I'm here to tell you about StoryStation, a tool to get your stories written and with a little elbow grease, produced!

#### even closer up

HOST (winking)
And hey, maybe one day people will be downloading YOUR movies from The Pirate Bay.

Show shots of the computer screen with closups of the different fountain language features in the editor.

= The Storystation script editor uses the fountain scriptwriting format, a code-like text format that allows you to easily define characters, action, dialogue, scenes, cuts and other showbiz terms. You can find more info on that at fountain.io.

= Fountain is a great open-community language for traditional screenwriting, but Storystation has added a few flavorings to take the functionality to the next level. Let's take a look at some of these features now.

= Fountain allows you to break your story down into sections using hashtags. These actually have some meaning in Storystation-flavored fountain. One is an Act, 2 is a sequence, 3 is a scene, and 4 is a panel. And number four is the one that really has significance.

= On a panel, with we can define 2 additional properties whose significance you will see in just a minute. Those 2 things are 1) and image and 2) a duration. Let's add those in.

Some time passes

= Now we have a complete script and we've added images and durations to our panels, let's see the magic happen by now switching our editor over to "player" mode.
