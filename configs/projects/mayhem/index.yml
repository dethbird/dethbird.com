        Kind of the central protagonist here. He himself is a comic artist, but is friends with a lot of comedians. Has the ability to huck anvils out of thin air. Went to art school but bartends at Zebtron's Comedy Club under owner Carl Leander.

        He's a bit like Ronnie Wood mixed with Bugs Bunny. He's a good 'ol boy at heart. He really tends to Carl Leander, kind of looks up to him as a father.

      description: |
        A slavik man who got in showbiz early from his acrobatic parents. Has a twin brother Max Leander who runs a showbiz deli. They both ride tiny motorcycles (like Billy and Benny McCrary of Guiness fame). At their bar and diner, they sell their line of brews such as Carl Leander's Downtown Chunky: Heavy Beef Broth Porter.

        He's not a sleazebag like the other impresarios, often to his detriment. The other impresarios sometimes take advantage of him, and Bob has to come in a save the day.

      name: Rory Shazbutt
      age: 25
      occupation: Comedian
      role: supporting
      description: |
        He is Bob's younger cousin by at least 12 years. He's been divorced. He has a bit of early Marc Maron syndrome in being a bit cantankerous and not having found that thread of love that comes after some age. He's still an angry young man, very bright. But his comedy is not for everyone.

        Bob gets it, but that's because they grew up together and thus have some in-jokes that only the 2 of them get.

        Rory has a bunch of older cousins, they love to drink Johnny walker. They corner him at family gatherings when they are drunk and offer him "advice." Get married Rory, c'mon you're 25.

        Rory starts seeing comedy as his almost one and only escape, do the detriment of being there for his family and friends.

        She's one of those "I'm one of the guys" female comics. That's not a bad thing -- it's like Sarah Silverman or Amy Schumer. She scores jokes on herself about alcohol consumption and promiscuity a lot. She hangs with Bob and Rory on occassion.

      occupation: Comedian, Odd Jobs
      role: supporting
      description: |
        This guy probably works harder than everyone. He's got some of that stand-off-ish unlikeability that Jack Roy must have had. He sells jokes out of the trunk of his car in front of the comedy club sometimes, otherwise he's involved in scamming the elderly in various jobs.

        Is a sweetheart but has broiling underlying temper issues. A bit hulk-like in that way. If you ask him to do something, he will grit his teeth and be like "sure I'd love to" and then punch a cat and kick an anvil across the room through the window.

      description: |
        The sister of Don Sandwichbottom. She is attractive and ends up getting commercials more than success as a comedian. Other comedians hit on her but she's a little too smart for them. She and Bob are on and off, we are not sure if they are an item but she does make relationship-related jokes on stage that make you wonder. Or specifically, make Bob wonder.

        I mean he THINKS he his funny, that's what's important right? He's actually a product designer. All his jokes are like "What if Steve Jobs was in <latest Hollywood Release>?". He tries making fun of Android on stage. He does a lot of blow and drinks while at Zebtron's.

        Now this guy from Jersey burbs starts showing up at red carpet events. But he's a good guy. Because of the word "undiscovered" in his tagline, he gets more gigs and tastemaker attention than he probably should.

        This book has so much info about the history of comedy. There are amazing and interesting stories about comedians and their lives. The stuff about all hanging out in the drug store not buying anything but using the payphones to talk to their managers and agents whose offices were just upstairs. This is all at around 50th st and Broadway in 1950's Manhattan, which is the time that should be referenced for visual design. Also other high style product/interior designs from the 1950s.

        The stuff about the Marx Brothers riding the rails to get to their gigs across the nation. The rise of fall of entertainment stars with evolving media (radio and television).
