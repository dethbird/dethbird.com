        Kind of the central protagonist here. He himself is a comic artist, but is friends with a lot of comedians. Has the ability to huck anvils out of thin air. Went to art school but bartends at Zebtron's Comedy Club under owner Carl Leander.

        He also has a blues rock band and shreds at guitar. Funny music scene stuff happens to him.

        He's a bit like Ronnie Wood mixed with Bugs Bunny. He's a good 'ol boy at heart. He really tends to Carl Leander, kind of looks up to him as a father.

        A slavik man who got in showbiz early from his acrobatic parents. Has a twin brother Max Leander who runs a showbiz deli. They both ride tiny motorcycles (like Billy and Benny McCrary of Guiness fame). At their bar and diner, they sell their line of brews such as Carl Leander's Downtown Chunky: Heavy Beef Broth Porter.

        He's not a sleazebag like the other impresarios, often to his detriment. The other impresarios sometimes take advantage of him, and Bob has to come in a save the day.

      age: 27
      occupation: Comedian
      role: supporting
      description: |
        He is Bob's younger cousin by at least 12 years. He's been divorced. He has a bit of early Marc Maron syndrome in being a bit cantankerous and not having found that thread of love that comes after some age. He's still an angry young man, very bright. But his comedy is not for everyone. It most likely stems from the trajedy he witnessed when he was younger of the comedian getting crushed the marquee that for the very first time bore his name. And he thought showbiz is stupid, comedy is still great. And comedy is the best way to get through tough times.

        He believes that a comic should have itegrity, has solid comedy heroes. He's not sure what he wants from fame, but he strongly believes that going up and saying what you feel is the only respectable way to "make it" in this industry. He will soon find out showbiz does not feel the same way.

        Bob gets it, but that's because they grew up together and thus have some in-jokes that only the 2 of them get.

        Rory has a bunch of older cousins, they love to drink Johnny walker. They corner him at family gatherings when they are drunk and offer him "advice." Get married Rory, c'mon you're 25.

        Rory starts seeing comedy as his almost one and only escape, do the detriment of being there for his family and friends.

        She's one of those "I'm one of the guys" female comics. That's not a bad thing -- it's like Sarah Silverman or Amy Schumer. She scores jokes on herself about alcohol consumption and promiscuity a lot. Although she doesn't want it, she finds that a lot of her success is coming from her sex appeal from that her work which she is frustrated by but that's what showbiz wants. Larry Joe further exasperates this by telling her she needs to sex it up. consequently, she is the only act he has picked up from the club. ... because he wants to sleep with her of course.

        She hangs with Bob and Rory on occassion.

      occupation: Comedian, Odd Jobs
      role: supporting
      description: |
        This guy probably works harder than everyone. He's got some of that stand-off-ish unlikeability that Jack Roy must have had. He sells jokes out of the trunk of his car in front of the comedy club sometimes, otherwise he's involved in scamming the elderly in various jobs. He doesn't do it maliciously of course, but in a bind and in need for money he somehow got involved.

        Is a sweetheart but has broiling underlying temper issues. A bit hulk-like in that way. If you ask him to do something, he will grit his teeth and be like "sure I'd love to" and then punch a cat and kick an anvil across the room through the window.

        Possibly Larry Joe tells him to tone it down. So he goes to Dobble for 'ludes which completely 180 his act and turn him into a Steven Wright which my twist of fate ends up skyrocketing his career. Then the invevitable happens, he runs out of drugs and does another angry set and suddenly his fame is gone and he's selling jokes from his trunk again.

        The sister of Don Sandwichbottom. She is attractive and ends up getting commercials more than success as a comedian. Other comedians hit on her but she's a little too smart for them. She ends up getting romantically involved with Rory, but then gets more attached than he is. He starts avoiding her texts but one thing he can't avoid is her coming to the club and doing her set. In which she tears him to shreds. People are like "wow her material got dark in like a week!"

        Maybe Rory has a bit of that thing where whatever he touches turns dark.

        The cops come in one day and just nonchalatly shoot him dead one day, not even talking to him but someone else entirely. Almost subconsciously just in the middle of convo the officer just aimed off to the side and shot him as a non-sequitor.

        This book has so much info about the history of comedy. There are amazing and interesting stories about comedians and their lives. The stuff about all hanging out in the drug store not buying anything but using the payphones to talk to their managers and agents whose offices were just upstairs. This is all at around 50th st and Broadway in 1950's Manhattan, which is the time that should be referenced for visual design. Also other high style product/interior designs from the 1950s.

        The stuff about the Marx Brothers riding the rails to get to their gigs across the nation. The rise of fall of entertainment stars with evolving media (radio and television).

        Comedy Megacorp snatches up comedy clubs and television stations with it's terrible comedy. The start coming at the Marquee Theatre, and the gang must defend it. Eventually, for the money, Carl Leander accepts it. When Comedy Megacorp takes over, the notes start coming in. Comedians are required to compromise their artistic integrity and they revolt. When that doesn't work so well, they enlist the mob who already control comedy clubs. Not a good idea. Now the mob is extorting and Comedy Megacorp is clenching. And the gang has no hope. Except cartoon violence.
